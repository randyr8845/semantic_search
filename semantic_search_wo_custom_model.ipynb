Drowning precautions should include       -  Fences around pools    -  Supervising children near any body of water, including tubs    -  Not swimming or boating when under the influence of alcohol or sedatives    -  Wearing life jackets when boating    -  Learning CPR\n",

Hazardous sound levels are louder than 80 decibels. That's not as loud as traffic on a busy street. Listening to loud music, especially on headphones, is a common cause of noise-induced hearing loss.

To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.)

Clinical trials are the best way to find out whether a particular intervention actually slows, delays, or prevents Alzheimers disease.

If you touch them or things they have touched, like fencing or buckets, wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well.     Though they may be cute and cuddly, wild animals may carry germs, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.    Pets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles, snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small.

To prevent animal bites and complications from bites       -  Never pet, handle, or feed unknown animals     -  Leave snakes alone    -  Watch your children closely around animals    -  Vaccinate your cats, ferrets, and dogs against rabies    -  Spay or neuter your dog to make it less aggressive    -  Get a tetanus booster if you have not had one recently    -  Wear boots and long pants when you are in areas with venomous snakes       If an animal bites you, clean the wound with soap and water as soon as possible.
