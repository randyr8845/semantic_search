Preschoolers are most likely to drown in a swimming pool. People who have seizure disorders are also at risk in the water. Drowning can happen quickly and silently.     Drowning precautions should include       -  Fences around pools    -  Supervising children near any body of water, including tubs    -  Not swimming or boating when under the influence of alcohol or sedatives    -  Wearing life jackets when boating    -  Learning CPR\n",

Normally, you hear these sounds at safe levels that don't affect hearing. But sounds that are too loud or loud sounds over a long time are harmful. They can damage sensitive structures of the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss.    More than 30 million Americans are exposed to hazardous sound levels on a regular basis. Hazardous sound levels are louder than 80 decibels. That's not as loud as traffic on a busy street. Listening to loud music, especially on headphones, is a common cause of noise-induced hearing loss. You can protect your hearing by       - Keeping the volume down when listening to music    - Wearing earplugs when using loud equipment       NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\n",

It can affect many organs:       - Skin - itching, hives, redness, swelling    - Nose - sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose    - Mouth - itching, swelling of the lips or tongue    - Throat - itching, tightness, trouble swallowing, swelling of the back of the throat    - Chest - shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, chest pain or tightness    - Heart - weak pulse, passing out, shock    - Gastrointestinal tract - vomiting, diarrhea, cramps    - Nervous system - dizziness or fainting       If someone is having a serious allergic reaction, call 9-1-1.
